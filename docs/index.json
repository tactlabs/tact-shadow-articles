	"content": "Addressing a class of West Point cadets in 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates asked bluntly, “How can the army break up the institutional concrete—its bureaucratic rigidity in its assignments and promotion processes—in order to retain, challenge, and inspire its best, brightest, and most-battle-tested young officers to lead the service in the future?” The question was, he said, “the greatest challenge facing your army—and frankly, my main worry.”\nThe secretary’s concern was not ill founded. In a 2009–2010 survey of 22,000 soldiers, 20% said they were serving under a toxic leader. Another survey showed that fewer than 50% of army majors believe the service promotes its best members. (The picture in the corporate world is similarly bleak. In one study, researchers estimated that half of senior executives were failing in their leadership duties. Another found that 16% of managers were toxic and 20% were incompetent.)\nIn response to such feedback, the army designed an entirely new process for selecting battalion commanders—its first executive-level position, typically attained 17 to 20 years after an officer has joined the service. It chooses approximately 450 a year, each of whom is responsible for the training and development of 500 or so soldiers. Battalion commanders thus have an outsize influence on combat readiness and junior-leader talent retention; they are also the primary source of generals. That’s why Army Chief of Staff James McConville put the overhaul of their selection process at the core of his talent reform efforts.\nOver the coming year the first class of officers appointed under the new system will assume their commands. The selection process, which capitalizes on recent and emerging talent-management ideas from both the public and the private sector, includes physical fitness, cognitive, communication, and psychological tests; peer and subordinate feedback; and interviews rigorously designed to reduce bias. While specifically aimed at improving the validity, reliability, and developmental impact of the army’s executive leader choices, it offers important lessons for any organization seeking to bolster its talent assessment and promotion practices.\nTransforming an Industrial-Era Process It’s little wonder that the army suffered a crisis of competence in its leadership ranks. Ever since centralizing its officer selection process, in the 1980s, it had chosen battalion commanders by having multiple senior officers simply score each eligible lieutenant colonel’s file, which contained subjective performance evaluations, an assignment history, and an official photo. On average, some 1,900 officers would be eligible for consideration each year. Each file review took about 90 seconds; the key text examined in each performance evaluation was shorter than a typical tweet.\nChanging course in any large bureaucracy is never easy, of course, and the army faced all the usual obstacles and then some. The dominant laws governing its personnel practices had been written in 1947 and 1980. They directed that several thousand second lieutenants a year be commissioned, brought up to a minimum level of competence, and assigned and developed on the basis of seniority, specialty, and performance. People were managed largely as if they were interchangeable parts—and the system was more or less frozen in place because of its codification in law. But in 2018 Congress passed the John McCain National Defense Authorization Act, which granted the army the flexible personnel authority it had lacked. McConville—then the vice chief of staff—began making plans to improve the quality of the officer corps. The new process included cognitive, communication, and psychological assessments.\nMcConville arguably has more HR experience than any previous army chief of staff. Having spent three years as deputy chief of staff for personnel—the service’s lead human resources officer—he has insight into the diverse talent needed in the thousands of army jobs. As a former commander of the 101st Airborne Division, he has learned that every soldier possesses unique skills and that the army’s diversity is increasing. And as the parent of three young army officers, he knows firsthand that generational norms are changing and that Millennials and Gen Zers want more control over their careers.\nConsider one of the problems he recognized. Let’s say the army needed to appoint an officer to advise an allied army overseas. Under its legacy system, it would identify candidates with the appropriate seniority (company commander) and specialty (logistics), perhaps reviewing their performance evaluations to make sure they ranked in the top 20% of their peers, and then choose from that pool. But whereas succeeding as a company commander mainly involves directly leading people who are similar to oneself, succeeding as an adviser abroad involves indirectly influencing people who may be quite dissimilar—and doing so in an unfamiliar environment. Simply giving the job to the best company commander would be unlikely to yield the best match. Better results could be obtained by identifying individuals with superior cognitive flexibility, cross-cultural fluency, and interpersonal skills. Moreover, if the army knew which officers enjoyed international travel and meeting people from different cultures, it could choose someone whose talents and preferences were suited to the position, most likely ending up with a high performer who would enjoy and remain in the job.\nRecognizing the need for adaptation that scenarios like this presented, McConville set out to transform how the army acquires, develops, employs, and retains its people, beginning with the linchpin role of battalion commander.\nStarting from the Ground Up\nFirst, the army redefined talent as the intersection of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and preferences, or KSB-Ps. Next, McConville energized and resourced the Army Talent Management Task Force—a small group of officers charged with prototyping innovative talent-management ideas—directing that inclusiveness should lie at the initiative’s core. (Disclosure: I serve as an external adviser to the task force, and I moderated one of the interview panels in the new selection process.)\nThe task force researched army leadership doctrine and identified best practices from government, corporate, academic, and nonprofit organizations and allied militaries. It then designed the Battalion Commander Assessment Program, or BCAP: a four-day evaluation of more than 20 KSB-Ps, including communication skill, creativity, ethical leadership, and the ability to develop others. During the first three days candidates would undergo a physical fitness test, writing skill and argumentative essay examinations, cognitive and strategic talent assessments, psychometric tests, and a psychological interview. They would demonstrate their leadership and problem-solving abilities in a team-based outdoor obstacle course, and extensive peer and subordinate evaluations would be reviewed. The process would culminate on the fourth day with 30-minute interviews in which panels would evaluate candidates’ oral communication skills and decide who was ready for command. Those deemed so would be ranked according to a cumulative score informed by their BCAP assessments along with the rating assigned after a legacy-style review of their performance file (which the army still considers a valuable part of the selection process). The top 450 or so would be designated for command.\nFollowing two successful prototypes in the summer of 2019, McConville directed a full rollout of the program. During January and February 2020, 750 lieutenant colonels—eligible officers who opted to participate after being recommended on the basis of an old-style file review—gathered for the new assessment process at Fort Knox.\nImplementing Strategies to Reduce Bias\nThe human brain is lazy; we are constantly looking for shortcuts when processing information. Interviewers are no exception. Research has shown that unstructured interviews are often the least-informative part of an assessment. Even experienced interviewers may spend the first 30 seconds of a meeting jumping to a conclusion about the candidate and the rest of the time subconsciously seeking information to confirm that conclusion.\nTo guard against such shortcuts, the task force designed a full day of familiarization, calibration, and training for the BCAP panelists. Handpicked colonels were trained to serve as moderators to maintain a fair and consistent process. The work was guided by the following principles: Create diverse panels.\nThe selection process spanned four weeks, with six panels operating simultaneously each week. Each panel had five voting and three nonvoting members and was assembled for diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity, specialty, and previous assignments. According to army tradition, voting privileges are limited to officers one level or more above the position under consideration; the voting members of each BCAP panel included three one- or two-star generals and two senior colonels, all of whom had been successful battalion- and brigade-level commanders. The nonvoting members, included to provide additional perspectives, were a command sergeant major with extensive experience advising battalion commanders, a senior operational psychologist, and the moderator.\nConduct in-depth antibias training.\nPanel members were taught strategies for preventing the attributional errors that occur most often during job interviews, including primacy (a tendency to focus on first impressions), contrast (rating candidates against one another instead of against a common standard), halo/horn (allowing a single positive or negative trait to overshadow all else), stereotyping, and similar-to-me biases. The training also emphasized the tendency among leaders to exhibit blind-spot bias: recognizing that others may be biased but falsely believing that you are not. Each morning the panelists received a brief antibias refresher before beginning their work.\nDon’t let panelists evaluate candidates they know.\nAt the outset, panelists were given the names of the candidates and asked if they had any knowledge of them. This allowed organizers to create panels whose members had no preconceived notions about the people they were evaluating. Panelists were told to recuse themselves if they realized during an interview that they knew the candidate, which happened five times.\nLevel the playing field.\nInterviews can unfairly advantage candidates who have extensive interview experience. During the BCAP prototypes, the task force noted that whereas some lieutenant colonels were excellent interviewees, most were not. So candidates were instructed in the STAR method, which teaches people to answer questions by describing the situation, the task, the action taken, and the result. Although they were not required to use it, a majority did.\nCalibrate grading.\nTo ensure a single grading standard, panel members were given a rubric for each quality to be assessed that described what was needed to attain each score. Before the panels began their assessments, they met together in practice sessions. First, each panelist independently assessed three mock candidates, and the entire group discussed the results. Members then regrouped in their panels to assess three new mock candidates and go over those results. Each group of mock candidates included one who was strong in the KSB-Ps, one who was moderately strong, and one who was weak.\nUse double-blind interviews.\nBorrowing a best practice devised by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1952, BCAP conducted double-blind interviews, with a black curtain separating the candidates from the panel at all times. This allowed panelists to focus on the content of answers and the KSB-Ps they were assessing rather than form judgments on the basis of ethnicity, attractiveness, or physical symbols such as wings on their uniforms. It minimized attribution biases that might be sparked by candidates’ physical presence. And it meant that deep issues could be discussed without fear of repercussions should candidates and panel members work together in the future. The task force also directed candidates not to disclose, and panel members not to ask about, specific jobs they had held or locations where they had worked.\nAlthough double-blind panels reduce bias (a test showed that the sergeants major incorrectly identified 50% of BCAP’s minority candidates as white), they don’t eliminate it. It’s usually easy to determine gender, and panelists may consciously or subconsciously try to link pitch, accent, speaking style, or content with a certain demographic. Candidates who learned English as a second language or hailed from the deep South, for example, might have readily discernible accents. So the bias-prevention work stressed the need not to penalize or reward speaking styles or accents.\nTap psychological expertise.\nApplying a best practice long used by special operations units, BCAP brought operational psychologists into the process. Each of six senior psychologists supervised several junior colleagues conducting one-on-one interviews with candidates before their day-four interviews with panels. The senior psychologists collected summaries from the junior ones on the candidates seen that day and presented the results to the relevant panels in a standardized format. Because they did not interact with candidates themselves, they could be much more objective in conveying information about them. They also synthesized each candidate’s BCAP assessments into a summary of strengths and weaknesses and suggested follow-up questions for the panel to pose.\nDesign questions for clarity and fairness.\nThe task force developed a bank of behavior-based questions for each KSB-P being assessed, rotating them in and out to reduce the chances of their being leaked. For instance, a candidate might be instructed to “describe a situation when you advised a subordinate about a significant challenge he or she was having.” In the first segment of each interview, the moderator asked questions from the bank in a set order, thus ensuring that all candidates had the same core experience. He or she then posed any questions the panelists had after reviewing the candidate’s performance in the first three days of events and hearing the senior psychologist’s summary. Panelists could themselves follow up with questions intended to further illuminate strengths or risks.\nPanel members were directed to elicit descriptions of specific situations and the actions taken in response and to avoid hypotheticals such as “would,” “could,” and “should.” For example, instead of asking, “How would you deal with an underperforming subordinate?” they might say, “Please tell us about a recent time when you developed a subordinate who was underperforming.” Candidates were required to wait 30 seconds before answering each question—an instruction driven by what psychologists know about certain personality traits. Because extroverts are typically comfortable thinking out loud, whereas introverts tend to process information silently, the waiting period was meant to ensure that the former did not have an unfair advantage.\nTo further ensure fairness, panelists were instructed not to give feedback or discuss candidates’ answers and to refrain from any body language, such as a thumbs-up or an eye roll, that could signal approval or disapproval to fellow panelists.\nHear from those the candidates would lead.\nBorrowing a best practice from Google, which involves an applicant’s potential team members in the interview process, each panel included a command sergeant major—roughly equivalent to a general manager’s senior operations foreman. Those asked to participate had served as advisers to battalion- and brigade-level commanders and general officers and had keen insights about what the job of battalion commander requires. After each interview they shared their insights about the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses in each KSB-P. To minimize recency bias, they were directed not to indicate their overall assessment of the candidate. Identify and head off aberrant votes.\nAfter the sergeant majors’ comments, panels held nonbinding votes on each KSB-P, with results visible to the moderator alone. If two panelists differed significantly on an assessment, the moderator asked them to give the reasons for their rating without sharing the actual scores. To avoid having the senior officer in the pair exert undue influence, the junior officer went first. Make voting confidential.\nNext, panels held their official vote. The moderator reminded members to base their ratings on the rubrics and not to identify their votes or discuss the candidates. With their votes panelists submitted comments about candidates’ developmental strengths and weaknesses in each KSB-P; those were relayed to the junior psychologists, who conducted a short “out briefing” with each candidate. Monitor panels in real time.\nTo ensure consistency and fairness across panels, the general directing the BCAP initiative held daily meetings with the moderators, giving guidance and asking for input on issues, voting trends, and needs. Each day he observed at least one interview per panel via a live closed-circuit camera system. He would occasionally drop into panel rooms where members were wrestling with procedural issues and offer advice. The six moderators, the director, and a panel coordinator communicated regularly on a closed channel, sharing issues, concerns, and best practices in real time. Panelists could ask that the director observe their panel or visit it before or after an interview to clarify procedural concerns; such requests were accommodated rapidly, often within seconds.\nBringing Key Stakeholders into the Process\nThe organizational change expert John Kotter holds that a crucial step in leading change is building a guiding coalition. BCAP asked for input or participation from several key stakeholder groups: peers and subordinates of the candidates, including the sergeants major, and general officers.\nGather opinions from peers and subordinates.\nPrior to the assessments at Fort Knox, BCAP leaders emailed 10-minute surveys to candidates’ peer and subordinate officers. The pivotal question: Should the individual be given a battalion command? More than 65% of recipients responded (response rates for army surveys typically fall below 15%). In reviewing the survey results, panelists were reminded that leaders sometimes have to be stern and that they should consider negative feedback in context: If a clear majority of answers about a candidate were positive, negative responses to one or two items should be deemed outliers.\nA vast majority of the candidates were recommended for command by a vast majority of their peers and subordinates—suggesting that most lieutenant colonels are leading well, although some are not. Candidates completed the BCAP process regardless of the survey responses, since those were just one of several factors considered.\nBring strategic leaders on board.\nThe army’s current generals rose through the ranks via the old selection process, so careful thought had to be given to obtaining their buy-in. McConville asked the service’s 12 four-star generals to weight the assessments used to generate candidates’ final scores, thus signaling that senior leadership was behind the program and that everyone else was expected to be too. As mentioned, three one- or two-star generals sat on each panel. Because the selection process involved 24 panels in all—six panels in each of the four weeks—72 of the army’s one- and two-star generals, or more than 20%, took part.\nGauging Early Outcomes and Looking to the Future\nThe BCAP assessments cost $2.5 million in travel fees, supplies, equipment, and so on, along with the opportunity cost of participants’ time. What did the army gain in return? BCAP’s most immediate impact will be on the soldiers led by the 436 newly selected battalion commanders. Remarkably, 150 of the new commanders, or 34%, would not have been chosen on the basis of legacy-style file reviews alone; although their file scores did not place them among the top candidates, their strengths in the BCAP assessments lifted them into that group. Moreover, 25 candidates whose file reviews would have earned them a posting under the old system were deemed “not ready for command” by their interview panels, many because they exhibited strong and consistent evidence of toxicity. Since future generals will be drawn mainly from today’s battalion commanders, these results mean that tens of thousands of soldiers (and their families) ultimately stand to benefit from commanders who are more fit, more capable, better communicators, and more thoughtful. (The army generally doesn’t publish demographic information about those selected for command.)\nThe process also generated benefits for the candidates, regardless of whether they were tapped for command. The week at Fort Knox reconnected them with old acquaintances and introduced them to new ones. As we know from network theory and social psychology, strong professional networks increase one’s ability to get things done, while strong personal networks boost emotional stability and well-being. And all candidates (even those denied the promotion) were offered follow-on leadership development with a civilian executive coach, to work on findings from the process or on self-identified areas for improvement. A majority signed on, including 64% of male officers and 84% of female ones. Even seasoned interviewers may instantly jump to a conclusion about a candidate. In exit surveys 96% of the candidates, including 98% of women and 96% of minority officers, said that BCAP was a better way to select commanders. Two months later, after candidates had learned the results, 97% thought the new program should be continued. Some 11% called for major modifications—such as additional feedback, different evaluation criteria and events, and alternative assessment timelines—that will be analyzed and addressed for the future.\nFollow-up surveys and an after-action review revealed an unanticipated benefit: panelists’ own development. Although some generals initially questioned why they had to spend valuable time improving the process by which they had been chosen, in the end 95% of the panelists said they believed it was a better way to select battalion commanders. Some were grateful to be refreshed on the issues facing younger leaders. Many reflected on their own leadership behaviors, often commenting that the training made them aware of their biases and the need to lead more inclusively.\nThe process also provided important information about the panelists. In a few years the army will know which new commanders are successful. Because it recorded all the votes on each candidate, it could identify especially effective evaluators and invite them to serve on other selection boards.\nAnd the initiative’s effects extend beyond those who went to Fort Knox. BCAP opened the army’s eyes to the possibility of creating a broader culture of evaluation and feedback. Some West Point instructors have adapted the writing rubrics for use in teaching cadets. At least one army unit is organizing a mock BCAP so that future candidates can increase their fitness and their writing and oral skills. The service is also considering using many of the assessments for the development of officers with four or five years of experience. The evaluations could be repeated several years later, allowing officers to see how they had grown (or not). At both points they could help officers and the army alike optimize assignments and development programs. As officers practice the skills spotlighted in the assessments, their abilities will increase, making for stronger leaders even among those who are never chosen for a battalion command.\nFinally, the army has used the BCAP template to design a similar program for selecting brigade-level commanders. And building on BCAP’s inclusion efforts, the Talent Management Task Force recently established a formal diversity and inclusion initiative that extends across its various programs.\nBCAP has given the army the most carefully vetted class of battalion leaders in its history. Candidates say they gained valuable perspectives and learned much about themselves. Soldiers asked to evaluate peer and superior officers were sent a clear message that their opinions matter and that leaders are expected to treat them with respect. Generals and colonels serving on the panels received a powerful refresher in what junior officers experience in their daily jobs and the skills they need to do them well. Many panelists also underwent the most thorough bias-reduction training they have ever received—which should drive more-inclusive treatment of the people they themselves lead.\nSummary:\nThe U.S. Army has long struggled with toxic and inept leaders, and no wonder: It has historically chosen battalion commanders, a linchpin position, on the basis of 90-second file reviews. Last year it undertook an ambitious revamping of that selection process, which now involves four full days of physical, cognitive, and psychological assessments and interviews. The author, a lieutenant colonel who served as an adviser to the task force that designed and implemented the new process, describes it in granular detail, including a variety of rigorous measures for reducing interviewer bias and ensuring diversity and inclusion. Although specifically aimed at improving the validity, reliability, and developmental impact of the army’s executive-leader selections, the redesigned process offers important lessons for any organization seeking to bolster its talent assessment and promotion practices.\n"

	"content": "Jeff Bezos Touches Space Aboard Blue Origin Rocket\nThe Amazon founder, his brother, aviation pioneer Wally Funk, and a paying passenger were the first to test out the New Shepard suborbital rocket system.\nIN 1994, JEFF Bezos and his then-wife MacKenzie drove from New York City to Seattle so he could start a new company to sell books on the internet. Assuming a normal highway speed, they would have zipped past 65 mile-markers every hour during their 2,500-mile journey. Today, funded by the billions of dollars he made from that much-expanded company, Jeff Bezos traveled the most important 65 miles in his life: straight up, to the doorstep of space. It took him a little over three minutes to achieve that altitude. He was the first passenger on New Shepard, the suborbital rocket system built by his company, Blue Origin.\nJoining Bezos—and the ranks of the 580 people who have previously traveled to space—were his brother Mark, 53, a volunteer fireman and philanthropist who now runs an equity fund; Mary Wallace “Wally” Funk, an 82-year-old aviation pioneer who was denied a chance to become a Mercury astronaut because she was a woman; and Oliver Daemen, an 18-year-old student whose bid of millions won him the distinction of becoming Blue’s first paying customer. (He actually was an underbidder; the unknown person who originally won the auction with a $28 million bid postponed their fight due to “scheduling difficulties.”) The latter two are now the oldest and youngest humans to sample space travel.\nLasting only ten minutes and twenty seconds, the flight seemed flawless, from launch to touchdown. It began with a show of confidence, the crew bubbling with enthusiasm as they prepared, and ended in a jubilant reunion of the new-minted astronauts as they reunited with their loved ones after their brief time away.\nThis suborbital jaunt by Bezos and his crewmates marks a long-overdue entry into the human spaceflight club for Blue Origin, which he founded in 2000. (In contrast, the US crewed space program, initiated after Russia launched its Sputnik satellite in 1957, took only 12 years to get to the moon.) But deliberation was built into Blue Origin’ modus operandi: The company’s motto is “Gradatim Ferociter,” Latin for “step by step ferociously.” Its mascot is a tortoise.\nBut something happened this year that led Blue Origin to perhaps skip a step or two. It had been widely assumed that the seats in Blue’s first human flight would be filled by its own employees, including at least one of several astronauts on the payroll. But after 15 painstaking test flights, and numerous revisions of the estimated timeline for when New Shepard would carry humans, suddenly Bezos announced that he would be joining others for a flight on July 20—the anniversary of the first moon landing. Maybe it wasn’t a coincidence that earlier this month he stepped down as Amazon’s CEO.\nAt the time, fellow space billionaire Richard Branson hadn’t yet announced that he would ride in his own company’s rocketship on July 11. (That hasty decision was made to slide in before Bezos’ flight—the Virgin Galactic founder had previously announced he would travel on a test flight later this year.)\nWhatever the reasons, Bezos’s announcement was surprising. Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith defended the plan in a preflight briefing, saying that the two most recent test flights proved that all systems were ready, and since everything controlling the spacecraft runs autonomously, there was no need for human practice. “We didn’t see any value, quite honestly, from doing things stepwise,” he said, skipping straight to the ferocious part of the company’s motto. So there would be no human test flight, but a high-stakes maiden voyage with the boss, his brother, an octogenarian, and a teenager.\nIn the run-up to the flight, the normally press-shy company suddenly turned show biz, releasing glossy videos and photos of the crew decked out in their bright blue jumpsuits. Original plans to accommodate a modest press contingent got jettisoned like a booster rocket, as the company invited dozens of reporters to its remote location in the West Texas desert, where Bezos owns over 300,000 of acres and even a mountain range.\nAt 7:25 Central Daylight Time, on the company’s launch pad, the passengers climbed five flights of steps, scaling the height of the 160-foot New Shepard reusable rocket, pausing briefly inside an fireproof “astronaut safety shelter,” a tightly-enclosed fireproof room that can be used in the event of an emergency evacuation. Then Bezos led the crew to cross a skybridge—each ringing a silver ceremonial bell as they crossed—to the capsule, which rests on New Shepard like, well, a sex toy. At 7:34, they entered the hatch and buckled themselves in. Funk stuck a postcard of herself as a Mercury 13 candidate to her window, with plans to shoot a picture of it when she reached space. At 7:43, Blue Origin technicians closed the hatch and climbed down from the gantry. It was T-minus 21 minutes.\nThe two previous suborbital NASA launches—60 years ago—involved a lot of checking gauges and flipping switches. Bezos and his crew didn’t have any of that to worry about: New Shepard is completely AI-driven. They could watch the countdown from personal viewing screens on the sides of the large windows designed for a luxury view of the Earth and space.\nThere had been some reports of possible rain, but the day was stunning and clear. The countdown proceeded with only a slight hold at 15 minutes; then the count restarted. The system passed through a final two minutes of checks, all done by an auto sequence, and then a voice from mission control began the countdown: “10, 9, 8, 7, 6 … command engines start, 2 1.”\nAt 8:12 am, steam poured out of the bottom of the booster for a couple seconds. “We have liftoff,” said the voice from the small mission control room on the base. Then the rocket jumped like a dart, sailing upwards until all that was left to see was a fuzzy contrail, a donut signifying the temporary hole the sky that New Shepard had slipped through.\nAbout three minutes later, the capsule, RSS First Step, separated from the rocket and pushed past the Earth’s atmosphere. This was it: The crew was weightless. They were space travelers. While the live feed didn’t give the thousands of online viewers real-time video, you could make out some of the audio that captured the joyous exclamations as the crew unbuckled and floated.\n“Holy cow!”\n“Good God!”\n“Look out the window!”\n“Whoooooooo!”\nThe New Shepard rocket had already begun its descent to Earth when the capsule gently began the journey home. A sonic boom announced the rocket\u0026rsquo;s return, and in a burst of fire it landed safely on its pad. Not long after, the three red, white, and blue parachutes deployed above the capsule. “You have a very happy crew up here, I want you to know,” Bezos told the control room.\nThe capsule, having slowed to a mere mile or two per hour, flopped on the desert floor, unleashing a wide puff of smoke. The whole trip had gone by in a flash, a space voyager’s Quibi.\nBlue Origin recovery’s team raced their SUVs through the desert, fast-walking the last few yards to snap the hatch. And then, one by one, the jubilant crew emerged, whooping and hollering. These space geeks had, essentially, won a Super Bowl. Their families were there to greet them, as well as Bezos’ girlfriend Lauren Sanchez. Mark Bezos emerged first, then Daemen, then Funk, who held her arms aloft in the victory sign. Clearly she had yet to return to Earth. Finally Jeff Bezos stepped out and returned to Earth.\nPerhaps the most ecstatic crew member was Funk, who had been one of the Mercury 13, a group of women who underwent astronaut training in 1960 but were rejected by the government because of their sex. Today, she finally achieved her life-long goal.The same goes for Blue Origin’s first paying customer Oliver Daemen, though his life has so far spanned only 18 years. He has seven years to go to match the age of the previous record-holder of the youngest space traveler: Soviet cosmonaut Ghermon Tirov. When Daemen enters the University of Utrecht this fall, he will have the perfect topic for a freshman composition on how he spent his summer.\nBut as is expected of the world’s richest man, the day belonged to Jeff Bezos.\n“Even as a teenager, I had an increasing conviction that [space] was important, not just a fun thing to do but actually important,” he told me in 2018. “And with every passing year I have even more conviction that this is the most important thing I\u0026rsquo;m working on.”\nAnd work on it he will. Blue Origin has two more space tourism flights planned this year. In the works are multiple generations of space vehicles—powerful rockets to boost huge payloads in orbit, moon landers, and beyond. He’s fighting NASA to make it reconsider a multibillion-dollar moon lander contract that the agency granted to his rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX.\nBut now he will do it as an astronaut. It took less than 11 minutes to get there. Or 20 years.\n"
